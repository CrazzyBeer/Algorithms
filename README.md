# Algorithms
Some template algorithms for competitive programming

*Please note that most of them are my implementations based on the examples, videos, courses from the whole internet. I cannot assure anyone that those algorithm implementations are completly working in any situations, although I can state that practiacally all of them have been tested on real problems with strong and comprehensive tests.*

Language - C++, Python
